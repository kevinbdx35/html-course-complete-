## Development Commands

### Validation
- Use [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate HTML files
- Test accessibility with [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/)

### Local Development
- Open HTML files directly in a browser
- Use VS Code with Live Server extension for local development
- No build process required (static HTML files)

## Course Architecture

### Learning Path
1. **Progressive structure**: 9 modules building from basic to advanced concepts
2. **Practical approach**: Each module includes theory + exercises + examples
3. **Project-based learning**: Final project synthesizes all concepts
4. **Accessibility focus**: Emphasis on semantic HTML and web accessibility

### Module Structure
Each module follows this pattern:
- **README.md**: Theory, examples, and instructions
- **Practical exercises**: Hands-on coding practice
- **Progressive difficulty**: Building complexity through the course

## Key Educational Principles

- **Semantic HTML**: Focus on meaning over appearance
- **Accessibility**: WCAG guidelines and best practices
- **Modern standards**: HTML5 and current web standards
- **Practical examples**: Real-world use cases and scenarios

## Content Guidelines

- All examples should be valid HTML5
- Include accessibility attributes (alt, aria-labels, etc.)
- Use semantic elements appropriately
- Provide clear, beginner-friendly explanations
- Include practical exercises for each concept

## File Organization

- Each module is self-contained with its own README
- Exercises are organized by module correspondence
- Resources provide additional tools and references
- All content is in French for the target audience

## Notes

- This is a static HTML course (no server-side components)
- Focus on educational content and clear explanations
- Emphasize best practices and modern web standards
- Include validation and accessibility testing in workflows
